# Analysis of a Movie Dataset
This project focuses on analyzing a movie dataset by using Microsoft Excel as the base data source, performing data preprocessing using Power Query, and creating interactive visualizations in Power BI.This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow starting from raw data to a final dashboard.
# Tools Used
Power Query and Power BI
# Dataset
The dataset was sourced as a movie metadata Excel file containing structured information related to movies like 

•	Movie Title

•	Genre

•	Language

•	Release Year

•	Revenue

•	Rating

•	Duration (in minutes)

•	Budget

# Steps Followed
The raw movie dataset was stored in Excel format. The data contained numerical, text, and categorical fields, with some columns having null values, inconsistent formats, and unnecessary information.
# Step 1
# Data Preprocessing in Power Query
The Excel file was imported into Power BI and opened in Power Query Editor. The following preprocessing steps were performed

•	Unnecessary and irrelevant columns were removed

•	Column names were renamed for clarity and consistency

•	Null values were replaced with meaningful values such as “Unknown”

•	Data types were corrected for each column

•	Revenue was converted to currency or decimal format

•	Ratings were converted to decimal numbers

•	Release year was converted to whole number format

•	Duration values were transformed into a readable format where required

•	Text fields were cleaned using trim and proper case

•	Genre and language values were standardized

•	Duplicate records were identified and removed if present

After preprocessing, the cleaned data was loaded into Power BI
# Step 2
# Data Modelling and DAX in Power BI

•	DAX measures were created to calculate total movies count, total revenue, and average rating. Numeric formatting was adjusted to avoid unnecessary rounding, and currency formatting was applied where required.

# Step 3
# Visualization in Power BI

•	Visuals were designed without scrollbars. Top N filters were applied to show only the most relevant values. Consistent colour themes and meaningful titles were used to improve readability and dashboard aesthetics.

# Summary of Power BI Visuals

# Total Movies Count Card
Displays the total number of movies in the dataset.
# Total Revenue Card
Shows the total revenue generated by all movies.
# Average Rating Card
Represents the average rating of movies in the dataset.
# Top 10 Highest Grossing Movies Bar Chart
Compares movie titles based on revenue and highlights the top-performing movies.
# Movies Count by Genre Clustered Column Chart
Displays the number of movies available in each genre.
# Revenue by Genre Clustered Bar Chart
Shows the revenue contribution of each genre.
# Movies Released Over Time Line Chart
Illustrates trends in movie releases across different years.
# Language-wise Movie Distribution Stacked Column Chart
Shows the number of movies released in different languages.

# Key Insights

•	Drama has the highest number of movies, indicating it is the most produced genre.

•	Action/Adventure dominates in terms of total revenue ($8.4bn), even with fewer movies compared to Drama.

•	English-language movies account for nearly 99% of total gross revenue, making English the dominant commercial language in global cinema.

•	Other languages such as Spanish, French, and Mandarin contribute less than 1% combined.

•	Movie releases remained relatively low and stable until the mid-1900s.

•	A sharp growth in movie production is visible after 1990, peaking in the early 2000s.

•	The USA dominates movie production with 3.6K movies, far exceeding other countries.

•	Avatar is the highest-grossing movie ($0.76bn).

•	Titanic and Jurassic Park closely follow, each crossing $0.65bn.

•	The scatter plot shows no strong linear relationship between IMDb score and gross collection.

•	Several movies with average ratings generate very high revenue, while highly rated movies sometimes earn less.

# Final Outcome
The raw Excel data was successfully transformed into clean and structured data. Meaningful insights were generated using Power BI, and a clear, well-structured dashboard was created. This project demonstrates practical knowledge of data preprocessing, Power Query, Power BI visualization, and analytical thinking.
